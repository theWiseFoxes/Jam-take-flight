A few things to remeber when working with obstacles, to make sure they sync across scenes properly

1. 3d obstacles should have two metadata tags, 
    a. version3D, string of path to the obstacles packed scene  
    b. spriteFor2D, string of path to the obstacles 2d sprite

2. obstacles should be a child of the obstacle spawner

3. manually added obstacles to the 2d screen has some issues, manually placed obstacles should be on the 3d game screen

4. each one meter in the 3d screen is equalivent to the length/height of one cell on the 2d screen
